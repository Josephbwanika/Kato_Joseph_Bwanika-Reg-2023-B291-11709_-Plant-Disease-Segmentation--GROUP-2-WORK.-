## Project Overview
This project implements **automated plant leaf disease detection** using:
- **OpenCV** for image segmentation to isolate diseased areas.  
- **Deep Learning (EfficientNetB0)** for classifying different disease types.  
The system helps identify early-stage plant infections using AI-powered image analysis.
---

## Workflow Summary
### **Part A: Image Segmentation (OpenCV)**
- Convert leaf images to grayscale.  
- Apply **adaptive thresholding** and **morphological operations**.  
- Detect and outline diseased regions.  
- Calculate infection percentage based on pixel area.

### **Part B: Disease Classification (Deep Learning)**
- Dataset split: 75% Training / 25% Testing.  
- Used **EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)**.  
- Applied **data augmentation** to prevent overfitting.  
- Achieved **~94% accuracy** on test data.

## Results
| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Training Accuracy | 96.2% |
| Validation Accuracy | 94.7% |
| Test Accuracy | 94.3% |
| Loss | 0.18 |

**Example Prediction:**  
`Input: Tomato leaf → Predicted: Early Blight (Confidence: 97.8%)`
